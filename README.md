# Password Generator Website 💻 🔑 

 🔐 Overview:
 I developed a dynamic Password Generator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users create secure and customizable passwords. This tool ensures strong, random passwords that adhere to best practices in cybersecurity, enhancing online safety and password management.

🌟 Key Features:
(i) Generates random passwords with customizable length and complexity.
Ensures inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
(ii) Implements secure logic for randomness and unbiased character shuffling using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.
(iii) Simple, user-friendly interface designed for responsiveness on both desktop and mobile devices.
(iv) No password storage—ensuring complete client-side security.

💡 Challenges and Solutions:
(i)Challenge: Building logic to meet password complexity requirements while maintaining randomness.
 Solution: Designed a robust algorithm to combine predefined character sets and applied a shuffle algorithm to ensure secure, unbiased results.
(ii)Challenge: Balancing functionality with an intuitive design.
 Solution: Focused on clear UX and responsive design to ensure accessibility and ease of use.

🚀 Future Enhancements:
Adding password strength indicators and advanced customization options.
Integrating with password management tools for seamless saving and autofill.
